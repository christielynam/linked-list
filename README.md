At desktop page load, we created two input fields, which take the users' website title and a valid URL. Upon click of the enter button, if the URL is validated, a bookmark is propended to the bookmark library. The bookmarks the website title, the website url, a read button, and a delete button. The read button toggles a class of 'read'. The delete button removes a single bookmark. In pursuit of phase 3, we added the bookmark counter, which tallies the total, read, and unread bookmarks. Underneath this counter, we added a 'Clear All Bookmarks' button, which clears all bookmarks with the class of 'read'. Our site is responsive AF.
